1 Basics of Simple Linear Regression Model
Consider the SLR model: Y = 10.0 + 0.5X + ε, ε∼N (0, 1). and answer the following questions. (a) What is β0, β1 and σ2?
(b) WhatistheexpectedvalueofY ifwefixX=0?
(c) What is the probability of Y > 10 if we fix X = 2 ? (Hint: You could simulate it.)
2 Salary Data
We would like to understand the relationship between years of experience in a job and salary. The file Salary dataset.csv contains a random sample of 30 workers for the City of Chicago. We want to do inference using the SLR model:
Salary = β0 + β1YearsExperience + ε.
(a) Load the data and plot Salary against YearsExperience as a scatterplot. Do you think the
linear model is plausible for these data?
(b) Give an intuitive interpretation of the β1 parameter in the SLR model.
(c) Fit the SLR model using lm() and test whether β1 is statistically significant. Also, produce a 95% confidence interval for this parameter. Do you conclude that the years of experience have a strong correlation with salary?
(d) Suppose that a friend of yours has been working for 5 years with annual pay around $60,000. However, your friend is thinking of quitting. Try to convince your friend of staying for another 5 years by supplying the appropriate 95% prediction interval for the estimated salary.
3 Sampling Distributions
Start with the following R code:
beta0 = 2
beta1 = 5
sigma2 = 4
X = rnorm(100)
As in class, we will pretend that we don’t know the true parameter values.
(a) Simulate 100 values for Y from the linear regression model Y = β0+β1X+ε, where ε ∼ N(0,σ2). Calculate the least squares estimates b0 and b1 of the true parameters β0,β1, respectively. Also get s2, the estimate of σ2 from R’s output. Are the estimates close to the true values? Why are the estimates not exactly the same as the true values?

(b) With fixed X vector, generate the sampling distribution of b1 and plot its histogram. Verify that the center of this histogram is around 5 and briefly explain why this happens.
(c) From (b) plot the histogram of (b1 −β1)/s1 where s1 is the standard error of b1 from R’s output. Show that this is very similar to the standard normal distribution.
4 The Case of Zillow Offers
Here, we consider the case of Zillow Offers that used complex predictive analytics to flip houses for profit, but unfortunately ended in a debacle.1
(a) Load the full Ames House dataset and plot Price against Quality. Then, consider the SLR model
Price = β0 + β1Quality + ε.
Test whether β1 = 0. What is a plausible range for the monetary value of a “one-unit of house
quality” ?
(b) Now, let’s focus on a subpopulation of “fixer-uppers”, houses of low quality we would like to renovate and sell for profit. Define this subpopulation as follows.
     fixer_uppers = house %>% filter(Quality <= 5) %>% select(Quality, Price)
How many houses are in this subpopulation? What is their average quality?
(c) Suppose we renovated these houses and increased their Quality by 3 units:
     Xf = fixer_uppers %>% select(Quality) %>% mutate(Quality=Quality+3)  # quality+ 3
     P = fixer_uppers$Price                                         # original prices
     P_new = predict(..., newdata=Xf, interval="prediction")       # new prices
Fill in the ‘...’ above to produce a 95% prediction interval for the prices of houses in Xf.
(d) In (c) , P is the cost of buying and P new contains estimates of the sell prices after renovation.
• Use sum(P new[,1] - P) to estimate the total profit from selling after renovation.
• Also, use sum(P new[,2] - P) for the same calculation. Why is this a conservative estimate
of the total profit from selling after renovation?
(e) An economist in your team suggests that the above model is too simplistic to predict profit because it does not take labor and selling costs into account. The economist proposes the following model:
• After we buy the house, we need to wait T wait (months) to find a crew to complete the renovation.
• A crew finishes the work in T labor months with a cost of $labor cost per month.
• After renovation, it takes T sell months for the house to be sold.
• The maintenance cost of a house is $maint cost per month (incl. repairs, taxes, etc). The property “sits idle” for T wait + T labor + T sell months from the time of purchase.

After market research, we come up with the following numbers:
     T_wait = 0.1 # wait time to find labor
     T_labor = 2 # 2 months of work
     labor_cost = 10000 # cost of labor/mon
     maint_cost = 300 # maintenance cost/mon
     T_sell = 6 # 6 months to sell
Argue why the following code gives revised profit estimates according to the economist’s model:
     P_new[,1] - labor_cost*T_labor - maint_cost*(T_wait + T_sell + T_labor) - P
What is the total revised profit? How does it compare to the estimate from (d)? Also, calculate the conservative total profit estimate from:
     P_new[,2] - labor_cost*T_labor - maint_cost*(T_wait + T_sell + T_labor) - P
(f) The model in (e) does not consider frictions in the labor market. Let’s assume that L = 5 construction crews in the region and we assign our properties sequentially to the available L crews. Then, the first L properties would have to wait for T wait to be assigned to labor, the nextLwouldwaitfor2Twait + Tlabor,thenextLfor3Twait + 2 Tlabor,andsoon.. Consider the following code:
     L = 5    # Total crews.
     T_wait_new = c()
     cnt = 1
     while(length(T_wait_new) < length(P) ) {
       T_wait_new = c(T_wait_new, cnt*rep(T_wait, L) + (cnt-1)*rep(T_labor, L) )
cnt = cnt + 1 }
T_wait_new = head(T_wait_new, length(P))
Confirm that T wait new has the correct waiting times as described above. Then, calculate the
revised profits from (e) but using the new waiting times as follows:
     P_new[,1] - labor_cost*T_labor - maint_cost*(T_wait_new + T_sell + T_labor) - P
Is the total profit positive? Consider also the conservative profit estimates:
     P_new[,2] - labor_cost*T_labor - maint_cost*(T_wait_new + T_sell + T_labor) - P
What is the conservative estimate of the total profit? Do you see something concerning?
(g) Argue why T sell may also not be the same across all properties, and argue that this could lead to further reduction of estimated profits.
(h) Based on this exercise, discuss briefly what went wrong for Zillow Offers. Try to relate to anything else you can find about this case from online sources.
5 Hubble’s Law and Bootstrap
According to Wikipedia,2 Hubble’s law is the observation in physical cosmology that galaxies are moving away from Earth at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, the farther they are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. Hubble’s law is considered the first observational

basis for the expansion of the universe, and serves as one of the pieces of evidence in support of the Big Bang model.
In this example, we will use a real dataset containing the velocity of various galaxies and their distance to Earth. Answer the following questions.
(a) Load the file hubble.csv. Fit an appropriate SLR model and provide statistical evidence in support of Hubble’s law.
(b) Produce the bootstrap 95% CI for the slope of velocity with respect to distance by completing the dots ‘...’ below.
     astro = read.csv("hubble.csv")
     sampl.boot = replicate(5000, {
       I = sample(1:nrow(astro), size=nrow(astro), replace=T)
       astro_new = astro[I,] # bootstrapped dataset
       fit = ...
       coef(fit)[...]
})
     se = sd(...) # bootstrap standard error
     76 + 2*c(-1,1)*se # Bootstrap CI.
Is this similar to the 95% CI obtained from (a) using confint?
6 Knowledge Transfer
The point of these exercises is to train you in transferring your 41100 knowledge to domains that we haven’t seen in class. Below is a regression output from a simple linear regression model in Stata, another popular statistical software.
(a) What do you think is the regression model here, and what is the scientific question behind it? (b) What is the p-value for the intercept? Is it significant? Is it one-sided or two-sided?
(c) Is time tv a significant variable? What does this mean in relation to (a)?
